Their detection typically relies on the Wineland parameter, estimated from measured spin variances and means. However, standard methods based on error bars fail to account for the possibility that similar statistics could arise from non-squeezed states, especially when measurements are limited. In a paper published in <a href=\"https:\/\/journals.aps.org\/prl\/abstract\/10.1103\/5svm-skxk\">Physical Review Letter<\/a>, we develop a statistical framework that recasts spin-squeezing detection as a hypothesis test, quantifying the likelihood that observed data could arise from a non-squeezed state. Our analysis reveals that many existing experiments, particularly those involving large spin ensembles (\u2265\u202f10\u00b3), do not collect enough data to draw statistically significant conclusions. Our method offers a rigorous and practical tool to certify spin squeezing under finite statistics and sets clear benchmarks for future experiments aiming to demonstrate quantum advantage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">26 Mar 2025<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"253\" class=\"wp-image-710 alignright\" style=\"width: 450px;\" src=\"https:\/\/quantum.paris\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor.jpg 1920w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-1536x864.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-700x394.jpg 700w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-520x293.jpg 520w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-360x203.jpg 360w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-250x141.jpg 250w, http:\/\/localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/04\/naturephyvictor-100x56.jpg 100w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/>Entangled particles is at the heart of the second quantum revolution. When such particles are measured, their entanglement manifests itself in the form of unique outcome statistics. These quantum statistics are key to estimate relevant physical quantities and can sometimes even let us completely identify the physical model describing the entangled objects, a feature known as \u201cself-testing\u201d. For these reasons, the set of all possible quantum correlations has attracted a lot of attention. However, despite decades of effort, this set has always resisted a direct analysis. In a new result published in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41567-025-02782-3\">Nature Physics<\/a>, we provide the first exact and complete description of a set of quantum statistics. This allows identifying limits of quantum theory itself, as it bounds the extent of experimental results one can expect to observe provided that nature abides to the rules of quantum physics. It also paves the way for exhaustive test procedures for quantum devices.

In 1969, Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) devised a linear inequality allowing to test J. S. Bell\u2019s prediction that the results of measurements on a pair of entangled particles don\u2019t admit a local model. Since then, remarkable Bell experiments have confirmed this prediction, resulting in numerous applications in quantum information such as secure cryptographic protocols. Yet, the exact set of experimental statistics that are achievable by quantum theory in such experiments remains poorly understood, even in simple scenarios. In this work, we use a novel approach based on duality, a mathematical tool that allows investigating a problem from two equivalent but very different perspectives, to shed new light on the geometry of the quantum set. Concretely, we show that the renown CHSH expression can be decomposed in terms of eight, more fundamental, expressions, each leading to a tight constraint on the set of quantum correlations. One implication of our findings is that an interesting part of the quantum set takes the form of an octagonal-based pyramid.

Storz and his colleagues from the Wallraff group at ETH Zurich showed that they are also suited to perform a loophole-free Bell test. By achieving a single-qubit readout of less than 100 nanoseconds, the ETHZ group was able to reduce the required qubit separation to around 30 meters to close the locality loophole. Then, they developed a low-loss cryogenic waveguide of this size to connect two fridges containing each a superconducting qubit to reach a high-fidelity two-qubit connected system. As a result, Storz and colleagues\u2019 set-up violates Bell\u2019s inequality by a higher margin than previous photon-based experiments, with a higher rate of data production than that obtained in previous matter-based experiments. This expands the superconducting circuit toolbox and shows that this platform is also promising for realizing device-independent quantum information tasks.

Researchers are therefore working on new encryption methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

This principle has proven particularly fruitful in studying generalized probabilistic models in Bell scenarios. With the recent\ngeneralization of Bell nonlocality to networks, we set out to examine with colleagues from Geneva, Bristol, Brussels and Zurich how the principle of no-signalling could be complemented by the independence assumption of distinct source inherent to networks. In a paper <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-020-16137-4\">published in Nature Communications<\/a> we show that the resulting condition of non-signaling and independence (NSI) gives rise to highly nontrivial constraints even in absence of measurement settings.

A remarkable link between them has been known for a long time, however, namely that every pure bipartite states violates some Bell inequality. In other words, the entanglement of a pure bipartite state can be demonstrated device-independently, a result sometimes referred to as Gisin&#8217;s theorem. Almost three decades later, we show with colleagues from the university of Innsbruck in Austria that this statement can be generalized to multipartite systems in the following way: the genuine entanglement of every pure multipartite state can be demonstrated device-independently. The algorithmic construction of Svetlichny-type inequalities that we propose to reach this conclusion is economical in resources and provides a natural level of resistance to noise.
